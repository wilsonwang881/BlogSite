It was a one-week course on JavaScript, Node.js and JavaScript frameworks and took place in Oxford, England. I designed an online accounting system using Node.js. It contained both the frontend and the backend (available [here](https://github.com/wilsonwang881/WebAccounting/tree/wilsonwang881-patch-2)).
