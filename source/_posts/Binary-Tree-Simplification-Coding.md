A piece of C++ coding used to build a simplified binary tree and evaluate the tree. The code is availabile [here](https://github.com/wilsonwang881/BinaryTree). A possible approach is recursive which differs from mine. My approach is outlined in [this report](Algorithm_and_Data_Structure_Binary_Tree_Coding_Report.pdf).
