The project was to design a remove control rover. The rover must be equipped with antenna and sensors for detecting and distinguishing wireless signals such as radio signals and ultrasonic waves. The project finished in May, 2017.

I was very lucky to work with people from China, Germany, Indonesia and Pakistan. The team worked on the appearance design, circuit construction, antenna building, code implementation and most importantly, documentation. I was responsible for coding and building the GUI for intuitively operating the rover.

The rover had a camera on top so that the operator could sit remotely to control the rover instead of having an eye on it. The control program was written in Python and used the PyGame to capture the keyboard event.
