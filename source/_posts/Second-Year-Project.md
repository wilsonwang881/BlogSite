The second year project was entirely decided by the students. No topics or instructions were given by teachers. I was working with another group of students this year and we decided to build a sign language translating glove. The project's archive could be accessed [here](https://wilsonwang881.github.io/Glovoice/).

The project consisted of programming, circuit designing and building, dynamic website construction and deployment, machine learning using Python and Tensorflow and documentation. I was doing the dynamic website as the interface for the glove. The final finished product was delivered in March, 2018.
