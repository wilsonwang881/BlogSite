Recently an email from GitHub stated that using OAuth credentials in query parameters has been deprecated and will be removed July 1st, 2020. While the existing comment system, Gitalk relies on OAuth credentials. Therefore Gitalk will be replaced. Disqus is a popular comment platform across the globe and it seems reasonable to give it a try.
