Previously the website was hosted on **AWS S3** but now it is time to migrate to **GitHub pages**.

<!--more-->

GitHub pages is free to use and has lots of features are already configured.

It is suitable for static websites and very easy to deploy when integrated with the **Hexo** plugins.

Every time the site content is generated locally using **Hexo**, the content can be uploaded to the GitHub repository using the integration **hexo-deployer-git** by running the commmand ```hexo deploy``` or ```hexo d``` for short.

The domain remains the same.
