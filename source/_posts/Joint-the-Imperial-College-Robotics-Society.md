The society has an amazing workspace, including a laser-cut machine. A number of 3rd and 4th year students at Imperial may also choose to work on their final year project at the ICRS lab.

I did both the laser-cut and 3D printing induction in the lab. Now I only need to pay for the materials and I can build anything using these machines.
