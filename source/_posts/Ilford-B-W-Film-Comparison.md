## Written Before the Post:

This post will be updated on a regular basis for 35mm true B&W films from Ilford. Please be noted that the comparison or suggestions will be very subjective based on my preference.

First, here are some basic details from [Ilford](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/black-white-film/35mm-film). Prices are in USD.

## Quick Summary:

| Film Series 	| Technology 	| Usage 	|
| :---	| :---	| :---	|
| Delta series 	| New technology 	| Better sharpness, less grainy at same ISO. 	|
| PLUS series 	| Established technology 	| Better for push and pull.  	|
| SFX 200 	| Higher red sensitivity 	| Use with red filter to produce infra-red like effect. 	|
| XP2 SUPER 	| C41 processing 	| Suitable for push and pull between 50 and 800. 	|
| ORTHO PLUS 	| Orthochromatic  	| Blue and green sensitive, not red sensitive. 	|

Ilford claims that the distinction between the so-called processional and consumer films does not exist in their products, unlike Fujifilm or Kodak, which, in their products names, indicate whether the films are for professional or normal usages.

However, the distinctions are made regarding the ability to push and pull, which allows films rated at fixed ISO to be shot at a different ISO, adding versitility to various lighting conditions. Pushed and pulled films will produce different grainy effect from their rated ISO, and require longer or shorter time of chemical processing.

The author has not personally processed any Ilford films. No comparison will be made on different chemical agents used in processing Ilform films.

## Detailed Specifications:

| Film Name 	| ISO 	| Price 	| Note 	|
| :---	| :---	| :---	| :---	|

| ORTHO PLUS 	| 80 	| 11.62 	| For landscapes with great sharpness, ISO 40 in Tungsten light, fine grain. 	|
| DELTA 100 	| 100 	| 9.4 	| Super fine grain with maximized detail and sharpness. 	|
| DELTA 3200 	| 3200 	| 12.48 	| High speed film for low light and fast action. 	|
| DELTA 400 	| 400 	| 7.29 	| Generic high speed film with maximized sharpness. 	|
| FP4 PLUS 	| 125 	| 6.48 	| For good light conditions, medium contrast, outstanding sharpness, fine grain. 	|
| HP5 PLUS 	| 400 	| 5.98 	| Medium contrast, all-purpose, high speed film, suitable for push and pull. 	|

## Let's Start:

The camera used is Nikon F5, "a camera imported from the future". Super bulky and heavy, but does the job quite well. The lens is a Nikkor 28-105mm f/3.5-4.5 AF-D one with a micro switch that allows shorter focus distance, yielding a maximum reproduction ratio of 1:2.

Using color filters with true B&W films is a good idea for boosting contrast and making colors more distinctive. For panchromatic films, color filters will make the film less sensitive to one region of the visible light spectrum. Hence the result is like making some colors brighter and some darker. Human eyes are more sensitive to yellow or green. Using a yellow filter produces B&W images that look more "pleasant" in the perspective of human visions.

Color filters act as ND filters as well, for the aim of reducing the amount of light entering the lens and a slower shutter speed. Different color filters have different levels of light reduction effect.
